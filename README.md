# MLProject
This project is the collective work of Tracy Cheng, Yiqi Wei, and He Wei for CS 663. The objective of the project was to train a linear regression model on the Ames dataset ('train.csv') with some added calculated values ($/sqft) and then test the accuracy of the model when predicting prices in the King County dataset. 

We found that while the predictions were surprising accurate for the Amse data set, the variance present in the King County data prevented the linear regression model from being highly accurate on the entire dataset. 

For future work, we propose that the King County and :Ames dataset be split into clusters by housing density/proximity in order to more accurately calculate the $/sqft values for each property.
